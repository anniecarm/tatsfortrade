            <p class="flow-text" style="padding-bottom: 3%;">Sitting on her windowsill looking out at the M train pass through her neighborhood is Diana Victoreen. Mumbling about lighting she pulls on an Edison bulb hanging from a hook on the wall next to her until the room is filled with a warm glow of light. Grabbing her cold brew coffee, she turns to be me and says with a laugh, “I’m nervous.”</p>

            <p class="flow-text">Diana Victoreen is a tattoo artist living in Bushwick Brooklyn. Her specialty is hand-poked tattoos, meaning there is no tattoo gun, just her steady hand pressing each dot of ink into the skin. For the past two years, she has grown to tattoo most of her friends, including me, and chooses to trade or barter for her work rather than accept monetary compensation.</p>

            <p class="flow-text">Growing up in Singapore, Diana said that societal sentiment around tattoos gave the"impression that they felt that people with tattoos were somehow less intelligent due to the decision to get a tattoo." But this didn't phase her, “I didn’t hold the same view," she said showing me the tattoos on her fingers.</p>

            <p class="flow-text">It all started two years ago with an Om tattoo on her friend Victoria's hand. She was in New York for the summer working two jobs but spent her offtime doing tattoos. She told me that her friends pushed her to start the Instagram and make her budding career online-official. Once the account was live, it wasn't long before the request for her work starting pouring in, “In my bio, I wrote DM me if ya dig and a lot of people will just be like ‘I dig!’,” she said.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">In the Summer of 2018, Diana tattooed a vegan lifestyle blogger, Remy Park, aka @Veggiekins, who has 83 thousand followers on youtube and 102 thousand followers on Instagram. “It was cool but like super nervewracking, cause I feel like I still felt like kind of new at tattooing at that point for sure,” Diana said. Park filmed the tattoo process for a video she called "Getting a Vegan Tattoo" which has now surpassed 9 thousand views on youtube. “I didn’t even know ink could be not vegan,” Diana said. The video brought Diana new clients/canvases to work on, but the stress of being exposed was not lost on her. “It was weird to know that like my work and process would be or potentially could be scrutinized,” she said. This was only the start.</p>

            <p class="flow-text">In the Fall of 2018, a woman who Diana had tattooed reached out to her. She was a producer for Broad City and asked to hire Diana to tattoo people at the wrap party for the final season of the show “It was the most legit thing I’ve ever done," Diana said. She told me she had tattoed for almost eight hours straight, not once looking up from her table. “People kept lining up and we had a list of like 50 people who wanted tats, I think I got to maybe 17 of them.”</p>

            <p class="flow-text">As handpokemami keeps gaining popularity, she tries to stay true to her philosophy on compensation. While some people prefer the pay-as-you-wish route, Diana likes to barter and trade for her work. “It felt weird accepting money in exchange for a tattoo and the experience of giving someone a tattoo,” she said, “I like the concept of bartering because it forces you to consider, okay what is this worth to me.”</p>

            <p class="flow-text">Her ideas on value and money stem from a strong dislike of capitalism. She told me that she wants to encourage people to work outside of the confines of capitalist thinking, enjoy the experience and participate in an exchange for her art rather than just handing over cash. She explained that for her, the art of tattooing is an intimate experience, and money takes away from that.</p>

            <blockquote>“Three hours of poking someone results in these lines that physically exist in the world. They are truly there, not because we believe they are there but because I’ve spent three hours putting them there, so it feels strange to introduce this middle thing of money cause like what the fuck does that mean? Nothing.”</blockquote>

            <p class="flow-text">“Every time anyone asks for a tattoo, I’m like holy shit I feel so honored,” Diana said. “Whenever someone comes by its always a cool experience" she said, "because its not really a typical way to interact with other people in your daily life, like sitting in such close proximity and like being in pain or causing someone pain for the sake of art, so its like definitely gets you out of typical barriers and ways of just sitting with other people.”</p>

            <p class="flow-text">Being handpokemami has allowed Diana Victoreen to reach new people, experience the dichotomy of connection and intimacy with strangers, and bring bartering into people's everyday lives. Carrying a notebook around with her at all times, Handpokemami is always ready for the next tattoo, telling me "I think everything is wacky and I just want to draw it."</p>
